Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Download the library dependencies and ensure they are in your PHP include_path.
3. Download and install the famfamfam icon set in /images/icons/
4. Add the Apache directives in httpd.conf (and restart the webserver) as per the example given in .httpd.conf.extract.txt; the example assumes mod_macro but this can be easily removed.

6. Access the page in a browser at a URL which is served by the webserver.
